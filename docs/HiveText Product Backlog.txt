Problem Statement
In certain collaborative situations, software developers may wish to work concurrently on various types of simple text files. These situations involve multiple users making numerous edits to the same file, that are visible to everyone. We will develop a desktop application, HiveText, that allows users to work simultaneously on any simple text file. It will be similar to existing text editors such as Sublime Text or Notepad++, and similar to other collaborative tools like git and Google Docs, but will improve upon these existing tools by allowing users to work concurrently on files while providing visual tracking of changes. A configurable consensus will be required to permanently save user changes. In addition, our application will provide users with a chat box with several channels for communication between collaborators working on the same file.


Background Info
Concurrent editing of files between multiple users is a domain with a multitude of approaches and several marketed solutions. There fails to exist a method of source control that allows coders to visually manage edits from  many users. HiveText aims to allow software developers, programmers, and coders alike to visually collaborate and decide upon changes made to shared files.
Current popular text editors such as Sublime Text and Atom exist, but do not include functionality for concurrent editing between multiple users. There are; however, existing platforms that allow separate users to work concurrently on files and chat with their collaborators. Some existing examples include Google Docs, Etherpad, and Gobby, but these hold their own drawbacks. Google Docs lets users concurrently edit rich text files, but has no support for plain-text files or offline editing. In addition, Google Docs forces user edits, allowing users to make unwanted changes and save them. Etherpad and Gobby allow for concurrent editing of plain-text files and support unicode. An additional drawback to Gobby is that usability is hindered by a difficult setup process. The major drawback of these concurrent editors is that they have no mechanism to accept or reject changes to the file made by users. HiveText strives to give users the ability to concurrently edit text files among multiple users with support for offline editing. In addition, HiveText will include functionality for a group to arrive at consensus, which will allow changes made to the file to be agreed upon by users before they are saved permanently.
