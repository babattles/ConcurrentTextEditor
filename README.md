# Problem Statement
In certain collaborative situations, software developers may wish to work concurrently on various types of simple text files. These situations involve multiple users making numerous edits to the same file, that are visible to everyone. We will develop a desktop application, HiveText, that allows users to work simultaneously on any simple text file. It will be similar to existing text editors such as Sublime Text or Notepad++, and similar to other collaborative tools like git and Google Docs, but will improve upon these existing tools by allowing users to work concurrently on files while providing visual tracking of changes. A configurable consensus will be required to permanently save user changes. In addition, our application will provide users with a chat box with several channels for communication between collaborators working on the same file.

# Project Objectives
Develop a desktop application that allows users to collaborate with other users on a shared file 
Implement an interface that allows online users to accept or reject changes to the shared file through a consensus
Implement functionality to allow users to download the current version of the document
Implement a chat box where collaborators can communicate on shared files
Implement functionality for user accounts to link files to their contributors
